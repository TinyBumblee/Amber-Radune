For the first set of pictures, I put apple123 in the string hash section and pressed "hash." This provided me with all the different string hash variants that you see in the second picture. 
The third picture shows me visiting the CrackStation website. I put in the MD5 string and it was able to figure out the password in seconds.

For this second set of pictures, I put in applesauce1234, as directed in the string hash. Once done, I pressed the hash button and copied the MD5 once again. 
After copying the hash, I visited the CrackStation website, pasted it in, and clicked the "Crack Hashes" button. Again, it only took a second to crack the password.

As I continued to experiment with the hashes, I used a few of my old passwords to see if CrackStation could crack them. 
Every time I would put the string hash into CrackStation, it would tell me that the password was not found. I posted a screenshot below.

By using this website more, it's astonishing to me to see how easily a weak password can be hacked, in just a matter of milliseconds. I knew that there were ways to hack passwords, but I didn't realize that the tools that hackers use to do so work so quickly. In all honesty, it's scary. It makes me think, "What can I do to ensure that my password isn't hacked?" Having a unique password is a good start, and setting up MFA for any account you have is another good step to take.
