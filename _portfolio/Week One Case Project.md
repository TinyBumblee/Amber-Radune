Case Project 1-1: Personal Attack Experiences

I personally experienced a computer attack where someone hacked into my Discord account. I
received a message on July 5, 2024, which appeared to be from a Discord staff member.
Initially, the message requested money from me, and by the time I understood what was
happening, it was already too late; my password had been hacked, and I was logged out of
Discord to allow them to log in. Discord is a popular communication platform, and I was using
the desktop application on my Windows PC at the time.

The damage became clear very quickly. The attacker took control of my account and began
sending fraudulent messages to my friends, telling them that I had accidentally reported them
and that I had also informed some of my other friends to report them. They were told to contact
Discord staff to avoid being banned.

To clean up the situation, I had to act fast. I immediately contacted Discordâ€™s support team to
report the account breach. I made a new Discord account to warn my friends that my original
account was hacked and to ignore any messages from it for now.

The computer itself was not permanently damaged, but regaining control of my Discord account
took time and effort. The attack could likely have been prevented if I had been more cautious
with suspicious messages and if MFA had been enabled before the incident occurred. Stronger
account security practices, like using a password manager to create unique passwords and
never reusing them across platforms, would also have helped protect me.

I believe the attack was successful for two main reasons. First, it relied on social engineering by
exploiting my trust in what I thought was Discord staff, which lowered my guard. Second, my
account did not have extra security measures like MFA in place at the time, making it easier for
the attacker to take control. This experience reinforced the importance of being cautious with
online links and always enabling the strongest security protections available
