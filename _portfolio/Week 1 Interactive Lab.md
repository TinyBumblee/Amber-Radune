**Project 1-3: Comparing Data Breach Notification Letters**

Below are the steps I took to gather the information for the data breach tables.

1. *Access the Database*
        I went to the California Attorney General’s Data Breach website (https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/databreach/list).


2. *Select Three Breach Notices*
   
        Farmers New World Life Insurance Company


        The Computer Merchant, Ltd.


        Mutual of America Life Insurance Company


4. **Download and Review the Letters*
   
   For each listing, I clicked Submitted Brief Notification Sample → Sample of Notice (PDF).


   I read through the letters and highlighted key sections:


        What Happened
   
   
        What Information Was Involved
   
   
        What We Are Doing
   
   
        What You Can Do
   
   
        Free protection offer (provider + months)
   
   
        Enrollment method and deadline
   
   
        Contact info
   
   
        Extra resources (FTC, state Attorney General info)


6. **Extract Key Facts from Each*
   
        Farmers Insurance (Aug 22, 2025): Vendor database accessed, 24 months of CyberScout monitoring, enrollment deadline Nov 25, 2025.
   
   
        The Computer Merchant (Aug 19, 2025): Cyberattack, full system restore, IDX protection (12–24 months + $1M insurance), deadline Nov 19, 2025.
   
   
        Mutual of America (Aug 20, 2025): Mis-sent secure email, Experian IdentityWorks 12 months, deadline Nov 28, 2025.


8. **Build Comparison Tables*
   
        Table 1 (Similarities): Elements all three letters had in common (company header, what happened, what info, monitoring services, deadlines, contact info, extra guidance).


        Table 2 (Differences): Unique details (breach type, protection provider, length of coverage, tone, extra services like $1M insurance or dark web monitoring).


10. **Summarize Findings*
    
        Similarities: All three offered free credit/identity monitoring, included deadlines and codes, and gave customers clear “What You Can Do” steps.


        Differences: Each had a different breach type, monitoring service provider, and length of coverage. Tone varied—Farmers was very formal, The Computer Merchant was more     customer-focused, and Mutual of America           emphasized prevention/education.


12. **Create Deliverables*
        I placed both tables into a Word document (Data_Breach_Comparison.docx) and also drafted an improved notification letter that combines the best elements: clear plain language, a precise description of data compromised, strong identity protection support, enrollment instructions, and practical next steps for victims.

**Reflection**
Which elements would be most useful if you were a victim?
The most useful elements in these letters are the clear explanations of what happened, the list of what personal information was exposed, and the specific steps the customer can take to protect themselves. I also find it helpful that they offer free credit monitoring and identity theft protection, which is especially valuable since they provide reassurance and practical tools to detect fraud. Finally, having a deadline and enrollment code included makes it easy to act quickly without confusion.

**What additional information would help?**
As a victim, I would want more precise details, such as the exact date the breach occurred, how long my information may have been exposed, and whether law enforcement is directly involved in the investigation. Knowing how the breach was detected and what specific security measures were taken afterward would also help me feel more confident. More transparency about the risk level of my data being misused would make the notice more helpful and less stressful.
