# Week 1 – Introduction to Security Awareness<br><br>
 
**Description:**  
We covered what Cybersecurity is which is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm. We also learned about The McCumber Cube which includes three protections that must be extended, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. I also learned that even if you don't have social media or an online persona you can still be at risk for losing personal information.

**Reflection:**  
From this experience, I learned that most cyberattacks don’t begin with complex hacking tools—they often start with simple tricks like phishing or social engineering. I learned that you don't even have to be on a computer to get hacked. It could be something as simple as getting your smart doorbell hacked. I also realized the importance of preventative security measures, such as enabling multi-factor authentication and using strong, unique passwords. These tools add extra layers of protection that could have stopped the attacker from gaining access in the first place. I will for sure be implementing these tools in my everyday life from now on to keep my identity and my personal information safe.

**Reflection:**
Write 1–2 paragraphs about what you learned and why it matters. Connect it to everyday security habits or the workplace.

AI Use Note:
If you used an AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.), briefly describe how you used it (e.g., brainstorming, proofreading).
