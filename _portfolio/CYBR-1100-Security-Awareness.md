# Week 1 – Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**  
We covered what Cybersecurity is which is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm. We also learned about The McCumber Cube which includes three protections that must be extended, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. I also learned that even if you don't have social media or an online persona you can still be at risk for losing personal information.

**Reflection:**  
From this experience, I learned that most cyberattacks don’t begin with complex hacking tools—they often start with simple tricks like phishing or social engineering. I learned that you don't even have to be on a computer to get hacked. It could be something as simple as getting your smart doorbell hacked. I also realized the importance of preventative security measures, such as enabling multi-factor authentication and using strong, unique passwords. These tools add extra layers of protection that could have stopped the attacker from gaining access in the first place. I will for sure be implementing these tools in my everyday life from now on to keep my identity and my personal information safe.

# Week 2 • Personal Cybersecurity
 
**Description:**<br>
This week we went over the main kinds of malware, like spyware, ransomware, worms, and rootkits, along with the usual warning signs that a system is infected—things like random crashes, slow performance, or weird programs showing up. We also talked about the different ways hackers break in, such as social engineering tricks, denial-of-service attacks, botnets, man-in-the-middle attacks, and password cracking. On top of that, we covered both hardware and software weaknesses, plus newer threats like cryptojacking, to show how attackers take advantage of flaws to steal information, mess with systems, or make money off their victims.

**Reflection:**<br>
This week, I learned that there are many more types of malware than I thought, and a variety of different tricks hackers use to gain access to systems, including social engineering, weak passwords, and flaws in hardware and software. I also didn’t realize how common the warning signs are—such as when your computer suddenly slows down, programs start acting strangely, or files simply disappear. It made me see how paying attention to little changes on your device can be the first clue that something’s not right.
This isn’t just important for personal matters—it really matters at work too, since one small mistake can put the entire network in danger. Doing simple things like creating stronger passwords, not clicking on sketchy links, keeping your software up to date, and double-checking requests for sensitive information can help prevent many attacks. Cybersecurity isn’t just an IT department’s problem—it’s something we all need to think about every day to protect our own data and the systems we use.
