## About Me

Hello! My name is Amber, and I’m currently a student at **Hocking College**, majoring in **Healthcare Informatics**.  

I’ve always been passionate about the intersection of healthcare and technology — how data, systems, and information can improve patient care and help providers work more efficiently. Through my studies, I’m building skills in health data management, electronic medical records, and information security that I hope to carry into my future career in the healthcare field.  

Outside of school, I enjoy learning new things, working on creative projects, and finding ways to combine my interests in both healthcare and technology. I’ve been using a computer since the fourth grade, and over time it’s become second nature to me. One of my favorite hobbies is gaming, which not only keeps me entertained but also fuels my curiosity about technology and how digital systems work.  

My goal is to continue growing in this field and make a meaningful impact in improving how healthcare information is used to support both patients and professionals alike.
