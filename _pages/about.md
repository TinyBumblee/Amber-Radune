## About Me

My name is Amber Radune, and I am currently studying Healthcare Informatics at **Hocking College**. Although I don‚Äôt have professional experience in healthcare or cybersecurity yet, I am very interested in how these two areas intersect and why they are both so important. What really interests me is the role cybersecurity plays in protecting sensitive medical records and patient information. In today‚Äôs world, where so much of healthcare relies on technology, keeping that data safe has become just as important as the care itself.</br>
As I continue my studies, I have noticed how quickly technology has become a major part of healthcare. Things like electronic health records, patient portals, and connected medical devices are now part of everyday medical practice. While these tools make care faster and more efficient, they also create risks if the systems aren‚Äôt adequately secured. Recognizing the importance of technology in this environment has motivated me to focus more on the cybersecurity aspect of healthcare. I believe that protecting patient data is about more than just technology; it‚Äôs also about trust.</br>
My career goal is to develop the technical skills that I need to work in the cybersecurity field, with a focus on healthcare. I want to help organizations safeguard patient information and protect their systems from growing cyber threats. As I learn more, I want to specialize in health information security, where I can work directly with medical records and systems. In the future, I envision myself in a role such as a cybersecurity analyst, where I can make a meaningful impact by helping healthcare providers enhance their defenses and ensure that patients‚Äô privacy is always protected.</br>
For me, this isn‚Äôt just about choosing a career path; it‚Äôs also about contributing to something that matters. Cybersecurity in healthcare is about protecting people at their most vulnerable moments, and I want to be part of that mission. By continuing to study and develop my skills, I am confident I can grow into a professional who helps bridge the gap between healthcare and technology.
